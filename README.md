# Front-End Preparation

### This GitHub repo will serve as a record of my development towards becoming a (competent) Front-End Developer, with some additional Back-End material covered as well. 

### For the moment, this repo will consist of the following:

* Information and code examples about JavaScript/ES6 features. 
* Information about Node.js and Express. 
* Information about CSS3 and semantic HTML5. 
* Information about data structures and algorithms implemented using JavaScript.
